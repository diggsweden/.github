# DiggSweden base .github-project

This is the standard Default .github repo for DiggSweden. It contains Pull Request-, Issue-templates and Community Health-files that will be applied for all projects in the whole GitHub-organisation "should the projects not override them with something more adjusted".

It also contains the front presentation text.

Contents:

## Docs:

- docs/how_to_work_github.adoc (How to work on Digg's GitHub)
- [docs/release1.0.checklist.md](docs/release1.0.checklist.md) (Checklist for preparing a 1.0.0 release)


- SECURITY.md (A general template for where to report Security Issues)
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (Contributor Covenant)
- Templates for the Pull Requests, Bug and Feature Requests
- profile/README.md (GitHub-organisation fronttext)


Note that these files are mostly taken from the general [Open Source Project Template-project](https://github.com/diggsweden/open-source-project-template) and any Issues should most likely go there directly.



## Renovate Configuration

This repository contains a shared Renovate base configuration that all DiggSweden projects extend.

### renovate-base.json

Centralized Renovate configuration providing:
- **Standardized settings** across all projects (7-day minimum release age, weekend schedule, Europe/Stockholm timezone)
- **Security presets** (OpenSSF Scorecard, vulnerability alerts)
- **Automerge policies** (minor/patch updates after tests pass)
- **GitHub Actions** digest pinning and grouping
- **Semantic commits** with git sign-off (build(deps) format)

Projects extend this base using:
```json
{
  "extends": ["local>diggsweden/.github:renovate-base"]
}
```

This ensures consistency while allowing project-specific overrides (managers, dependency grouping, etc.).
