# DiggSweden base .github-project

This is the standard Default .github repo for DiggSweden. It contains Pull Request-, Issue-templates and Community Health-files that will be applied for all projects in the whole GitHub-organisation "should the projects not override them with something more adjusted".

It also contains the front presentation text.

Contents:

- SECURITY.md (A general template for where to report Security Issues)
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (Contributor Covenant)
- Templates for the Pull Requests, Bug and Feature Requests
- profile/README.md (GitHub-organisation fronttext)
- docs/how_to_work_github.adoc (A document describing how to work on Digg's GitHub)

Note that these files are mostly taken from the general [Open Source Project Template-project](https://github.com/diggsweden/open-source-project-template) and any Issues should most likely go there directly.
